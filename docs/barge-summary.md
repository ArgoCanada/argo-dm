# Pre-Deployment Testing at DRDC Barge

## Scheduling

Logistics steps required to schedule time at DRDC barge:

1. Find a time that works for both parties, our contact is Mark Fotheringham
([Mark.Fotheringham@forces.gc.ca](mailto:Mark.Fotheringham@forces.gc.ca)).
2. The scheduled time will need to work for the Sigma-T to take you over to
the barge as well. Scheduling can be done by contacting
[SigmaT.CCGS@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:SigmaT.CCGS@dfo-mpo.gc.ca). A Google
calendar for the Sigma-T is also available to help select available times.
For any parties new to the vessel, a general statement of risk provided by the
ship must be signed and sent to the coxwain.
3. Ensure all COVID procedures are followed. From the DRDC side, a COVID
attestation for each party attending should be sent to Richard Pederson
[Richard.Pederson@ecn.forces.gc.ca](mailto:Richard.Pederson@ecn.forces.gc.ca)
a few days ahead of attending the barge. For joining a Canadian Coast Guard
vessel like the Sigma-T, a rapid test must be taken the day of.
4. Once scheduled times are settled circulate a detailed itinerary to all
parties involved. At this time, ensure all parties have proper PPE (life vest,
steel toed shoes, hard hat).

## Setup & Deployment

The DRDC barge has 4 davits, one on each corner of the moon pool. which are 
about 3m above the surface of the water. The Bedford Basin in this area is 
42m deep. From each davit, a weighted line measuring 38m is hung, making the 
maximum profiling depth for the float 35m. For the ARVOR floats, they can be 
programmed to profile and drift at this depth, however for the PROVOR floats,
the minimum profile and drift depth is 100m. This means that for these floats,
you must attached them securely enough to the line that they cannot escape the
line at the bottom. We did this by putting the line through a small loop (I 
used a 
[butterfly loop](https://www.animatedknots.com/alpine-butterfly-loop-knot)) of 
nylon rope before securing the weight, and then tying the nylon rope securely 
around the plastic piece of the float used for deployment. A large shackle was 
used for the weight at the bottom of the line.
