# Pre-Deployment Testing at DRDC Barge

## Setup & Deployment

The DRDC barge has 4 davits, one on each corner of the moon pool. which are 
about 3m above the surface of the water. The Bedford Basin in this area is 
42m deep. From each davit, a weighted line measuring 38m is hung, making the 
maximum profiling depth for the float 35m. For the ARVOR floats, they can be 
programmed to profile and drift at this depth, however for the PROVOR floats,
the minimum profile and drift depth is 100m. This means that for these floats,
you must attached them securely enough to the line that they cannot escape the
line at the bottom. We did this by putting the line through a small loop (I 
used a 
[butterfly loop](https://www.animatedknots.com/alpine-butterfly-loop-knot)) of 
nylon rope before securing the weight, and then tying the nylon rope securely 
around the plastic piece of the float used for deployment. A large shackle was 
used for the weight at the bottom of the line.
