Please do the entire launch procedure described below out on deck where the float has an unobstructed view of the sky. If performed inside and an Iridium satellite connection cannot be established, the float's self test will fail and the launch sequence will not complete. 

1. Remove 1 red and 2 white plugs. Remove black cap on blue oxygen sensor if applicable. 
2. Put float in vertical position.
3. Remove the magnet.
4. Listen for 5 valve and 5 pump activations.
5. Listen for beeper which will be active for 30 minutes. This may take up to 15 minutes to activate while the float performs its self test, as satellite connectivity times can vary. 
6. While beeper is active, deploy float (within 30 minutes of start of beeper).
7. Send lat/lon, date/time of deployment and serial # of float after each deployment (or send completed log sheet, attached) [e-mail: Chris.Gordon@dfo-mpo.gc.ca].

I'm also attaching the manufacturer's "Quick Guide" for reference. It has some good photos (i.e. what the red and white plugs and magnet look like) and examples of deployment techniques. We generally use the second (lowering the float into the water on a rope) but the ship's crew will likely have their own ideas. Basically, we'd like to see the float lowered into the water rather than chucked over the side. The "Quick Guide" also has detailed "deployment description" sheet to fill out. We are not requesting that you send us that level of detail on the deployment, the lat/lon, date/time and serial # is sufficient.
